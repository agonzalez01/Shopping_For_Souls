3D First person horror game

Group project where I am the only programmer. Includes a flashlight that toggles on and off, AI that plays sounds and chases the player only when the flashlight is on and the player is within range, power ups, and walking and running speeds with respective sounds.Menu systems to pause the game and travel between main menu, credits and game. Collectibles system consisting of three scrolls, each one with it's respective key. The keys interaction will only show up when the player has picked up the respective scroll for it. If the pplayer collects all three keys and goes to the exit door, they will win the game.
